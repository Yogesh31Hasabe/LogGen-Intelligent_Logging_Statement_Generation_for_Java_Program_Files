## üìñ Overview

LogGen is an intelligent solution for generating logging statements in Java programs. Built using advanced **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, LogGen identifies optimal logging positions and generates high-quality, contextually relevant log messages without altering the underlying code structure.

By improving logging practices, LogGen enhances **software maintainability, observability**, and **developer productivity**, addressing challenges like insufficient or overwhelming logging.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Logging**: Predicts "what", "where", and "how" to log efficiently.
- **Context-Aware Statements**: Generates logs relevant to runtime data, improving debugging and system monitoring.
- **Advanced LLM Integration**: Leverages state-of-the-art models like **CodeT5** and **LLaMA**.
- **High Performance**: Outperforms existing solutions with superior BLEU and ROUGE scores.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

LogGen employs a two-stage pipeline:

1. **Stage 1: Logging Position Prediction**
   - Uses an LLM to identify optimal positions for logging.
   - Annotates code with `<FILL_ME>` placeholders.

2. **Stage 2: Logging Statement Generation**
   - Replaces placeholders with semantically relevant log statements.
   - Ensures clarity, brevity, and contextual accuracy.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

LogGen achieves state-of-the-art performance using:
- **Stage 1**: Accuracy for predicting logging positions.
- **Stage 2**: BLEU & ROUGE scores to evaluate log quality and relevance.

| Metric         | Score   |
|----------------|---------|
| **BLEU**       | 0.6464  |
| **ROUGE-1**    | 0.8859  |
| **ROUGE-L**    | 0.8262  |

## üß™ Experimental Results

- LogGen achieves **36.84% accuracy** in predicting file-level logging positions.
- Generated logs surpass existing methods with BLEU and ROUGE metrics significantly exceeding competitors like **FastLog**.

| Model        | BLEU   | ROUGE-1 Recall | ROUGE-L Recall |
|--------------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **LogGen**   | 0.6464 | 0.9116         | 0.8556         |
| **FastLog**  | 0.3343 | 0.5991         | 0.5953         |
